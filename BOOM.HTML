<DIV ID="ANYTHING" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="Yellow"> <H5>How does AI work?
As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.

In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.

AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.

<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/machine_learning_with_python/machine_learning_with_python_types_of_learning.htm">Learning - Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.</a></li> <br><br><br>
<li><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/reasoning-in-artificial-intelligence">Reasoning - Reasoning plays a great role in the process of artificial Intelligence. Thus Reasoning can be defined as the logical process of drawing conclusions, making predictions or constructing approaches towards a particular thought with the help of existing knowledge. In artificial intelligence, reasoning is very important because to understand the human brain, how the brain thinks, how it draws conclusions towards particular things for all these sorts of works we need the help of reasoning.</a></li><br><br><br>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/self-correcting-robot-thats-telepathically-controlled-human-brain/">Self-Correction - This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.</a></li>
